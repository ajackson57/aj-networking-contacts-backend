## Instructions
- [Backend Server hosted on Heroku](https://gentle-crag-17128.herokuapp.com/)
- [Get application frontend Started](https://ajackson57.github.io/aj-networking-contacts-frontend/)
- As a user ypu must register for an account. Once an account is created you
  login and you can display, create, edit, and delete contacts.

## Technologies used.
- **Styling** - The Boostrap NAV bar and basic styling were used.
- **HTML** - A table is used to display the list of contacts.
- **JavaScript** - Events from the table, butons, and the navigation bar drive
  the application
- **Handlebars** - The contact table and entry form were done with html in
  handlebar tamplates.
- **Ruby on Rails** - The backend server was developed with Ruby's Rails
  framework. Ajax used on the frontend to make requests of the Rails server.

## The Devlopment Story
[Initial Schedule](https://github.com/ajackson57/aj-networking-contacts-frontend/blob/master/Schedule.pdf)
 - **The Development Process**
 - The development process started with some rough wireframes, some user
   stories, and a quick planning outline. I divided development into feature
   groups and created a branch in Git for each group. The branches for this
   repository (backend) were as follows:
     - backend - setup initial repository state using template from GA.
     - testScripts - write scripts to provide tests for initial get and created
       operations.
     - addUserReference - Add reference, 1-to-Many from user to contacts.
     - updateDoument - Update project readme file.
 - **Problem-Solving Strategy**
 - Testing and debugging of the web werver was through curl scripts and frontend
   api calls.

## Current Issues to be resolved in the future
- **Future Enhancements**
- Future enhancements may include the managment of job applications, resume
  version control, email tracking, and other career managment functionality.
